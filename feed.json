That's why the less time it takes to extract the most relevant information, the longer we can spend looking for any clues or evidence.<br><br>With this idea in mind I found in Github a script that looked very good from the user <a href=\"https://github.com/AlrikRr\">AlrikRr</a> (I invite you to take a look at his cool projects), specifically I'm talking about <a href=\"https://github.com/AlrikRr/Forensic-Extract\">Forensic-Extract</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking at his project I thought <em>\"OK, it extracts very useful information and records, but... what if I add the option to extract hives?\"</em>, so I took advantage of it and made a few more changes:<br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Translated the code into English</li>\n<li>Optimised the code as much as I could</li>\n<li>Added the option to extract hives</li>\n<li>Added a Microsoft Defender status checker</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see the project in my Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/b4shnhawx/DFIR4win/tree/main\">b4shnhawx/DFIR4win</a></p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://b4shnhawx.github.io/media/posts/5/dfir4win_demo_noav.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"774\" height=\"486\"></figure>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>DFIR4win can automate the collection of most of the data you need to analyse activity on a Windows machine and compress it all into a ZIP file.<br>It includes:</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevant host information</li>\n<li>Event logs</li>\n<li>Log hives (for more details, see Microsoft documentation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>If you want to extract the hives, you may need to disable the real-time protection of your antivirus (AV), as it may consider the action suspicious. By default, Windows uses Windows Defender.</p>\n<p><br>This script detects whether your active AV is Windows Defender or some other third-party antivirus. If it is the latter, it is possible that other modules of your AV are blocking the extraction of the files, so I recommend you to manually check if all the files you need have been extracted correctly.</p>\n<p><br>If the script is not working properly to extract the files, you can do it manually with a program (such as Eric Zimmerman's Registry Explorer).</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>This would be the final directory tree:<br><br></p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>./HOST_DD-MM-YYYY.zip\n |\n |-- REGS\n |    |-- *_HOST_DD-MM-YYYY.evtx\n |\n |-- HIVES\n |    |-- Security.hiv\n |    |-- SAM.hiv\n |    |-- DEFAULT.hiv\n |    |-- NTUSER_USERNAME.DAT\n |    |-- System.hiv\n |    |-- USRCLASS_USERNAME.DAT\n |    |-- Software.hiv\n |\n |-- Host-Info_HOST_DD-MM-YYYY.txt</code></pre>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>You have all the information about how the script works in the repository üòÅ</p>\n<p>¬†</p>",
